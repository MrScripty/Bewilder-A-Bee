# Bewilder A Bee

An generalised local/API agentic assistant. Gathers all your data accross multiple platforms and puts it into a local database so it can do stuff. What stuff? Basicly any stuff. Need to finetune a model to make a digital copy of yourself? Want to orchestrate Claude Code instances? Curate your email and social media feed? It does stuff.

Built on Pantograph and Pumas Library as part of Studio Whip development.
